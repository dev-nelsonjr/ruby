# Ruby Exercises

Each subdirectory in this repository is an exercise.

Each exercise consists of a README.md and a test file.

The test file uses the Minitest testing framework. To install it run the command:

    gem install minitest

If you have never used Minitest, check out [Intro to TDD][tdd] tutorial from Jumpstart Lab.
